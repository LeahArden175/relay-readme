1. *What is your ideal next role?*
My next ideal role is Sr. Software Engineer. I feel like this would be the natural next step in someone's growth within a company. In the long term, I would strive to be a project manager. I enjoy working with others to encourage growth.
2. *What most interests you about the Software Engineer - Full Stack position?*
I enjoy being part of a hardworking team and enjoy a work environment that encourages learning every day. I also have a passion for working with clients and making sure that their requirements are met.
3. *Do you require sponsorship?*
I do not require sponsorship.
4. *What is the last thing you learned/taught yourself that was not a direct requirement of your job/role at the time and why?*

5. *How do you organize yourself?*
I am a big proponent of having an organized calendar as well as having a personal planner. I like having a hard copy because writing things down can help me mentally solidify my schedule.
6. *What are your top 3 technical skills based on proficiency?*
My top three skills are Javascript, Node, and React.
7. *Which best describes you and why?*
*Our team is a mixture of these so there's no "right" answer.*
-*I like to focus on the details and get things right.*
-*I prefer to work on the bigger picture of things. I have a lot of ideas that I like to explore.*
-*I like to work on both, because I get bored if I just focus on one or the other for too long.*
"I like to focus on the details and get things right" is the option that describes me best. I strive to make sure my work is working correctly in all facets. 
8. *Talk about your preferred development environment. What is your current setup? What do you like the most? What would you change?*
I am currently using VSCode to develop and test my code. I enjoy that it has git integration and allows for many different languages. This makes it easy for me to push projects to GitHub and switch between branches. I would change the debugging tool because I find it can be a little difficult to use and is not always user friendly.
9. *If you could master one technology this year, what would it be? Is there something specific about this technology that excites you?*
I have been thinking of learning Python this year. I am very interested in how it relates to AI programming and would like to use it to create a project.
